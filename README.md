# Dipole trap calculator
This is an ipython notebook that has a GUI made in Bokeh to see different properties of a dipole trap.

The notebook describes how dipole trapping works, defines some functions that calculate different quantities related to a dipole trap (such as the potential depth, scattering rate, heating rate, recoil-limited temperature,... ) depending upon some parameters.
The current notebook plots the values of these quantities for a set of wavelengths, and it is possible to vary the power and waist of the dipole trap to update the views.
